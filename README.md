# MindConnect
MindConnect is a full-stack web application designed to promote mental well-being through accessible tools like mood tracking, journaling, and curated resources. Inspired by real-world mental health needs and companies like Mindhail, this project demonstrates my full-stack development skills using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js).
